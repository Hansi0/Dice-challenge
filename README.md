ðŸŽ² Introducing the Dice Challenge Game! ðŸŽ²

The goal was to create a simple yet engaging game where users could roll virtual dice and compete for the highest score. ðŸ¤–

The real magic happened with JavaScript. I implemented the logic for rolling dice, calculating scores, and updating the game state.!

ðŸŽ¯ How it works:
You roll the dice by clicking a button.
The dice will generate a random number between 1 and 6.
Your score is updated, and the leaderboard shows your ranking.
